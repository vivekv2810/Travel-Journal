## How to Run the Project

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)

- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-journal.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd travel-journal
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:3000``` to see the app in action.

## Folder Structure

- **App.js**: The main application logic that handles state and renders journal entries.

- **components**: Contains the ```Header``` and ```JournalEntry``` components, which are responsible for rendering the header and each individual journal entry.

- **App.css**: Styles specific to the layout of the application.

- **JournalEntry.css** and **Header.css**: Component-specific styles to maintain separation of concerns.

## Customization

To add new entries, modify the initial ```entries``` state in ```App.js``` by adding new objects with the following structure:

```
{
  id: 3, // unique ID for the entry
  title: "New Trip Title",
  description: "Description of the trip",
  date: "Date of the trip",
}
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add a form to allow users to input new journal entries dynamically.

- Integrate local storage or a database to persist user data.

- Add functionality to edit or delete existing entries.
